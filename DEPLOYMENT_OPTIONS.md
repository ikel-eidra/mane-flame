# 🔥 Mane Deployment Options - Clear Comparison

## Your Concern: "If Mane needs a computer, how can Vercel/Railway give it to her?"

**Answer**: Railway, Vercel, and VPS **ARE computers in the cloud!**

They're like renting a computer that runs 24/7 in a data center. Mane gets full access to:
- ✅ CPU to run Python/Node.js code
- ✅ File system to create and edit files
- ✅ Terminal to execute shell commands
- ✅ Network to deploy apps and push to GitHub
- ✅ Package managers (npm, pip) to install dependencies

**Think of it like this:**
- Your laptop = Computer at home
- Railway/VPS = Computer in the cloud (always on, always connected)

```

**The Process:**
1. You send: "Create a todo app"
2. Mane receives it on Railway server
3. Mane asks Gemini: "How should I build this?"
4. Gemini responds: "Use React, create these files..."
5. Mane executes on Railway server:
   - Creates project folder
   - Writes all files
   - Installs dependencies
   - Tests the app
   - Pushes to GitHub
   - Deploys to Vercel
6. Mane reports back: "Done! Here's the URL"

## Cost Reality Check

**Your Current Situation:**
- Manus credits: $200/day for development work
- Monthly: $6,000 if used daily

**With Mane on Railway:**
- Railway: $5/month (the computer)
- Gemini: $0-6/month (the brain)
- **Total: $5-11/month**
- **Savings: $5,989/month (99.8%)**

**What You Can Build:**
- Unlimited apps
- Unlimited deployments
- Unlimited GitHub pushes
- Process unlimited files
- 24/7 availability
